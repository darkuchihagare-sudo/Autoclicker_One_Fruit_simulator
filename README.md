# Autoclicker Script

This script is a simple autoclicker that can be used in "One Fruit Simulator" or any other game that requires you to stay active or click repeatedly.

# Prerequisites:

To use this script, you'll need Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to install the two main libraries that make the script work: pyautogui for simulating clicks and keyboard presses, and pynput for listening for the hotkeys.

You can install them both with this single command in your terminal:

Bash

pip install pyautogui pynput

# How to Use: 

1. Save the File

First, save the script as a Python file / example: autoclicker.py

2. Run from the Terminal

    Linux: Open a terminal and run python3 autoclicker.py.

    Windows: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run python autoclicker.py.

    macOS: Open Terminal and run python3 autoclicker.py.

 # Commands:

After you start the script, you can control it with these two hotkeys:

    h: Starts the autoclicker.

    i: Stops the autoclicker and closes the program.
