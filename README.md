I created this code for the game "One fruit simulator" on Roblox.
You can use it for every other game, it is still an autocliker.

# Prerequisites:
To use this script, you must have Python 3 installed.
You will also need to install two Python libraries:
 pyautogui: For simulating mouse and keyboard actions.
 pynput: For listening for the hotkeys
To install run this:
pip install pyautogui pynput

You can install them by running this command in your terminal:
# How to use the script on Linux:
1) save the file as "FileName.py"
2) open terminal (on ubuntu: ctrl + alt + t)
3) write python3 "FileName.py" / Example: python3 autocliker.py
   
   #  Commands:
   - h to start the script
   - i to stop it

- How to use the script on MacOs and Windows:
1) Figure it out yourself
